## questions

- [x] What does a convolutional layer do in NLP context? Specifically how does it convert a 2000 x 300 -> 2000 x 1 with one filter
- [ ] Strange behaviour Softmax - no change in loss, sigmoid - decreasing loss?
- [ ] Choice of hyperparatmeters loss optimizer metric (QWK?) activations (sigmoid or softmax)
- [ ] Overall score - Induvidual score relation (deterministic or learnable)
- [ ] How to proceed with more data?
